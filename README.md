# google-books-search

**Google Books Search is an exercise in full stack development skills with a focus on React and MongoDB.** I created this for the Coding Boot Camp at UNC-Chapel Hill in May 2019.

# Features

With Google Books Search, users can easily search, save, and preview the *content* of books with the full power of the Google Books platform.

In addition to the requirements of the assignment, I expanded the user's search options to Title, Author, and Subject. Users can enter search terms in any or all of those fields. I added a toggling navbar at the top of the page and a toggling "Add to Saved"/"Remove from Saved" button for each book result to instantly orient the user to the status of the app and the books they are viewing.

This application fulfills the bonus requirement of the assignment as well, broadcasting live updates of newly-saved books to any and every browser that is accessing the site. Newly saved book titles appear in a message just below the navbar.
